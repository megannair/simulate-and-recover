# Simulate & Recover: EZ Diffusion Model

This project implements a simulate-and-recover method using the EZ diffusion model to test if it can correctly estimate parameters from data that were generated by the EZ diffusion model. This is a common model used in cognitive science.

In order to evalute how acurate the EZ diffusion model is, I had to analyse the squared error (SE) for multiple different sample sizes for the values of N= 10, 40, 4000. The expectation for this was that the bias should approach 0 and SE should decrease as N increases. 

The conclusion was that the squared error rate (se_v) decreased significantly as N increased. This showed that larger sample sizes improve accuracy greatly. The other two squared errors (se_a and se_t) showed little to no differences in their values and remained relatively stable. Even though there was minor variability within the model, the trend suggests that while N is increasing, it enhances the model's performance which makes it very useful when it comes to cognitive modeling. Overall, the model is consistent and effective.
