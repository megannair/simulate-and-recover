# Simulate & Recover: EZ Diffusion Model

This project implements a simulate-and-recover method using the EZ diffusion model to test if it can correctly estimate parameters from data that were generated by the model itself. The EZ diffusion model is a simplified version of the standard drift-diffusion model (DDM), which is commonly used in cognitive science to describe decision-making processes. It models how individuals make choices based on the accumulation of evidence over time. The key parameters in this model include boundary separation (a), which represents the amount of evidence needed to make a decision, drift rate (v), which measures the speed and direction of evidence accumulation, and nondecision time (t), which accounts for all processes unrelated to decision-making, such as perception and motor response.

To evaluate how accurately the EZ diffusion model recovers parameters, I analyzed the squared error (SE) for different sample sizes (N = 10, 40, and 4000). The expectation for this experiment was that bias should approach 0 and squared error should decrease as N increases. This means that as the number of observations grows, the model should become more accurate in estimating the original parameters. Squared error measures how far off the estimated values are from the true values, so a decrease in SE as N increases would indicate better model performance.

The results showed that the squared error for drift rate (se_v) decreased significantly as N increased, which suggests that larger sample sizes greatly improve accuracy in estimating drift rate. The squared error for boundary separation (se_a) and nondecision time (se_t) remained relatively stable, showing little to no difference across different sample sizes. This indicates that the model is more sensitive to improvements in drift rate estimation compared to the other two parameters. Even though there was some minor variability within the model’s estimates, the overall trend suggests that as N increases, the model’s performance improves significantly.

These findings are important because they demonstrate that the EZ diffusion model is internally consistent and that it can reliably estimate decision-making parameters when given sufficient data. The significant improvement in se_v highlights how larger datasets help capture evidence accumulation more accurately, making the model useful in psychological and cognitive research. Since se_a and se_t did not improve as much, it suggests that these parameters may require alternative methods for better estimation. Despite minor fluctuations, the model is consistent, effective, and practical for use in cognitive modeling.

In conclusion, this experiment supports the idea that the EZ diffusion model is a reliable tool for estimating decision-making processes. As sample size increases, the model becomes more precise, particularly in estimating drift rate. This makes it a valuable approach for researchers studying human cognition and decision-making under time constraints.
